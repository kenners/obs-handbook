<p>The maternity unit at West Suffolk Hospital undertakes around 2600 deliveries each year (correct for 2016) with a Caesarean Section rate of 21% and an epidural rate in labour of around 15%. 93% of Caesarean Sections are performed under regional blockade.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Central Delivery Suite (CDS) provides 8 delivery rooms equipped with tipping beds, piped oxygen, Entonox and suction. There is also a room with a birthing pool (one of the 8), a room for postoperative recovery of mothers having had an uncomplicated Caesarean Section under regional blockade (Room J) and a bereavement suite within the Central Delivery area. Room E is currently used as our level 2 HDU close observation room. A resuscitation trolley with defibrillator is available on CDS. A four bed midwifery led birthing unit is situated adjacent to CDS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a dedicated obstetric theatre within the main theatre complex (Theatre 2). No other cases, including gynaecology, should be anaesthetised in this theatre.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Antenatal and postnatal patients are cared for on F11, with bay C being mainly used for mothers who have recently returned from theatre.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This handbook aims to outline your duties whilst on call for obstetric anaesthesia, as well as provide a summary of some of the more important guidelines. Full guidelines are available on CDS and on the Intranet in the Pink Book.</p>

<p>There is a 24 hour analgesia/anaesthesia service for obstetric patients. An on-demand epidural service is available and can be at the request of the mother, midwife or obstetrician. The anaesthetist will also provide assistance for resuscitation, management of complex clinical cases and also intravenous cannulation when others have failed, or when difficult cannulation is anticipated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are six consultant anaesthetists with 10 dedicated daytime obstetric sessions each week. Out of hours the on call theatre consultant will be the point of call for help.</p>

<p>Ensure follow up of mothers who have had any anaesthetic intervention. The outgoing night time bleep holder must follow up all mothers who have had any anaesthetic procedure and a record of the visit made in the anaesthetic register. We have an electronic database system (Euroking) for all data after all obstetric anaesthetic procedures and for follow-ups’. You will need to email <a href="mailto:elizabeth.botfield@wsh.nhs.uk">elizabeth.botfield@wsh.nhs.uk</a> to get login details for the system (she will need your hospital username that is assigned to you during your IT training at induction). One of the obstetric anaesthetists will show you how to enter data on to the computer during your induction.</p>

<p>We have a patient information leaflet which is to be issued to all patients who have had a spinal and or epidural anaesthesia/analgesia at the time of follow up. We also have another leaflet specific to headache after regional block. Please be rigorous with PDPH follow-up and ensure that the relevant leaflets are handed out to the patients. These leaflets are available on both labour suite as well as F11 ward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the night time bleep holder has been too busy, then it is their responsibility to pass this on to the daytime bleep holder who will perform the follow ups during the morning shift. All women who have received a regional anaesthetic (or had an attempted RA) MUST be given an information leaflet on complications of RA. Any woman who has received an epidural or an attempted epidural must have their motor block score recorded on the MEOWS chart at follow up. This does not apply to spinals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document any significant problems in the patient notes e.g. PDPH, persistent numbness, etc. Handover to the next shift or discuss with the consultant on call, as appropriate. Patients with significant complications should have their details including contact numbers kept for follow-up after discharge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All cases done overnight must be handed over to the oncoming consultant at the 08:00 ward round, especially the more complex cases. You are expected to stay until handover is done. We like to be able to give supportive feedback on your work and help sort out any problems you have encountered.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_introduction_2">Introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Historical practice for in-hospital intrapartum nutrition was to restrict oral food and fluid. This was founded on the rationale that fasting would decrease residual gastric volume, thus reducing the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality from pulmonary aspiration in the event of general anaesthesia.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maternal death from pulmonary aspiration is rare in the United Kingdom, with no reported cases in the 2014 MBRRACE-UK report. Contributing factors for this decline are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>increased use of regional anaesthesia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improved anaesthetic training and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the widespread use of antacids in labour (O’Sullivan 2009).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, with the increase in complex deliveries, especially women with obesity, it is possible that trends may increase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A 2013 Cochrane review found that for women considered at low risk of potentially needing general anaesthesia, there was no benefit or harm associated with restricting oral fluids or food. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference between groups regarding the outcomes of caesarean section rate, operative vaginal birth and five-minute Apgar score of less than seven. (Cochrane 2013).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eating and drinking may allow an improved feeling of well-being for women and may be permitted for low-risk deliveries. Eating a low residue diet for low risk deliveries is supported by NICE (2014) and the Cochrane review (2013). However, all staff must be aware that once a woman is in established labour, or once opioid analgesia has been administered by any route (including epidural), gastric emptying is significantly reduced. Therefore precautions to minimise the risk of gastric aspiration in the context of general anaesthesia do need to be undertaken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interventions for ketosis during labour have not been adequately studied and there is currently no consensus information on which to base treatment of women with ketosis in labour (Cochrane 2008).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For women at increased risk of potentially needing general anaesthesia, there is no evidence from randomised trials on which to base practice regarding food or fluids in labour (Cochrane 2013).</p>

<h3 id="_failed_intubation">Failed intubation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Failed or difficult intubation is a leading cause of anaesthesia-related maternal mortality and death. It is more often a result of hypoxia than aspiration of gastric contents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The incidence of failed tracheal intubation in the obstetric population has not decreased within the last 20 years despite the introduction of advanced airway techniques and stands at 1 in 224 in a recent UKOSS (UK Obstetric Surveillance System) study. Failed intubation is up to eight times higher than in the non-pregnant population and is associated with the older, heavier, higher BMI parturient with a Malampatti score greater than 1. A consistent cause of morbidity and mortality is both hypoxia relating to failure to intubate and ventilate and gastric aspiration which occurred in 8% of the cases of failed intubation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Physiology of the pregnant woman means that she is more likely to have difficulties in intubation due to oedema of the airway and she will become hypoxic quicker due to a raised basal metabolic rate. In addition, gastric aspiration can occur which can cause lung injury. All women should have antacid prophylaxis before entering theatre.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All anaesthetists should have knowledge and training in the management of the failed intubation and in the use of airway aids such as the LMA, Proseal LMA, intubation LMA, video laryngoscopes and the fibreoptic laryngoscope. It is important to recognise the possibility of the difficult airway before induction of anaesthesia and call for senior help early. There was a 2.5 fold increase in failed intubation in the trainee group of anaesthetists versus the consultant group.</p>

<p>Maternal safety is paramount. The main aim is to prevent maternal hypoxia.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The failed intubation algorithm is displayed in the obstetric theatre and is included in the appendix and can be read in conjunction with the Difficult Airway Society Algorithm for failed intubation (DAS 2015).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The primary duty of care of the anaesthetist is to the woman, so an appropriate course of action would be to wake the woman and proceed with a regional technique.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Trainees should decide on the safest option in their hands and will be fully supported by the consultant anaesthetists if they wake the woman, even in the case of fetal distress.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Exceptions to waking the woman and continuing anaesthesia with a non-definitive airway would be life-saving surgery such as maternal haemorrhage and cardiac arrest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It may be appropriate to continue with surgery in the case of severe fetal distress if the woman is anaesthetised and is ventilated safely with an LMA, Proseal LMA or intubating LMA if the anaesthetist is proficient with this technique and feels that it is in the best interest of the mother to continue with surgery.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Remember to place the patient on the Oxford wedge before induction of anaesthesia, this positions the woman into the 'sniffing the morning air position’ which can significantly minimise the risk of a difficult intubation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If not already present, call for the assistance of a second anaesthetist. Ultimately, this should be a senior anaesthetist, but any anaesthetist can assist with the initial management of a difficult airway.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a summary of the Guidelines: Antepartum Haemorrhage and Postpartum Haemorrhage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Obstetric haemorrhage is a leading cause of maternal mortality. It accounts for approximately 10% of all direct maternal deaths. It is also a significant cause of morbidity. Postpartum haemorrhage (&gt;500ml blood loss) affected 13% of all maternities in England 2011-12.The incidence of PPH is rising, and has nearly doubled from 7% in 2004/5 to 13% in 2011/12.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2009-2012 in the UK and Ireland there were 17 direct deaths due to haemorrhage. This gives a mortality of 0.49 per 100000 maternities, and a case fatality rate of 1 per 1200. There are other deaths in the most recent MBRRACE report associated with haemorrhage but are primarily attributed to other causes e.g. amniotic fluid embolus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There have been many recommendations to reduce the morbidity and mortality including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anaemia should be investigated and iron supplementation considered to optimise haemoglobin before delivery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observations should be charted on a MEOWS chart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerns should be escalated to a senior doctor or midwife if a woman deteriorates, and there should be a named senior doctor in charge of ongoing care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion should not be delayed because of false reassurance from a single haemoglobin result; consider the whole clinical picture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Young fit pregnant women compensate remarkably well therefore ongoing bleeding should be acted on without delay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use blood components to maintain coagulation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If pharmacological measures fail to control the haemorrhage, initiate surgical haemostasis sooner rather than later. Early recourse to hysterectomy is recommended if simpler medical and surgical interventions prove ineffective.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The speed with which obstetric haemorrhage can become life threatening emphasises the need for women known to be at high risk of haemorrhage to be delivered in a hospital. It is advisable that there is a blood bank, and appropriate laboratory facilities, including haematological advice and therapy on site.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Confidential Enquiry recommends that every unit should have a protocol for the management of haemorrhage and this should be reviewed and rehearsed on a regular basis. All members of staff, including those in the blood bank, must know exactly what to do to ensure that large quantities of cross-matched blood can be delivered without delay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is essential that both the Consultant Obstetricians and Consultant Anaesthetists are involved at an early stage in planning the elective management of women considered to be at high-risk.</p>

<p>Spinal anaesthesia has been administered following an epidural block. There is no consensus of opinion as to the dosage of spinal anaesthesia that should be administered following an inadequate epidural. Therefore inadvertently a high spinal could occur.</p>

<p>The regional techniques employed at the West Suffolk Hospital are intended to preserve motor function whilst alleviating the pain of all stages of labour. The anaesthetic department provide a 24 hour obstetric epidural service and aim to provide epidural analgesia within 30 minutes of being notified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Labour Suite provides programmed intermittent epidural boluses supported by patient controlled epidural analgesia (PIEB and PCEA). PIEB has been shown to decrease breakthrough pain requiring physician top-up, reduce local anaesthetic consumption without compromising analgesic efficacy and increase patient satisfaction by offering autonomy in pain relief during labour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use a pre-prepared low dose epidural infusion with Levobupivacaine (0.1%) and Fentanyl (2 micrograms/ml).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On occasions, the low doses of Levobupivacaine and Fentanyl can prove insufficient, so higher concentrations of Levobupivacaine (0.25%) and or a bolus of Fentanyl (50 – 100 micrograms) may be indicated on Labour Suite.</p>

tray or separate gallipot pot away from your other equipment, used and discarded before any other solutions or equipment is used minimise the risk of arachnoiditis.</p>

<li>
<p>The loss of resistance technique is a matter of individual choice for the anaesthetist; however, the preferred method for trainee anaesthetists is loss of resistance to saline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aim to leave 3 – 4 cms epidural catheter in the epidural space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The initial epidural loading dose is 10ml-20ml of the 0.1% Levobupivacaine with 2mcg/ml Fentanyl solution (premixed solution in 250ml bag).</p>

<li>
<p>This initial epidural loading dose can be administered using the clinician bolus facility

<p>Either a ‘two-space technique’ or ‘needle through needle technique’ can be used. Unless trainee anaesthetists have had training and been supervised in the ‘needle through needle’ technique, the two-space technique is preferred.</p>

<p>At an interspinous space below L3, an intrathecal injection of 1ml of 0.25% Levobupivacaine with 15mcg Fentanyl is given using a fine gauge pencil-point spinal needle. Use of a 26G or 27G needle is preferred as the risk of post-dural puncture headache may be less than for a 25G needle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the intrathecal injection, the epidural is sited in the standard way described above in a suitable lumbar interspace. It is advisable to flush the epidural catheter with about 2mls of 0.9% saline to ensure that blood clots do not block the catheter.</p>
</div>

<p>If the dura mater is inadvertently punctured during insertion of an epidural this is known as a dural puncture.

It may be less obvious if the dura is accidentally punctured by the epidural catheter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During a spinal anaesthesia the dura is intentionally breached. In this situation post dural puncture headache is less likely due to the use of finer needles. However, even though much finer needles are used, some women may still experience headaches. It is thought that this is due to the reduction in pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid.</p>
</div>

<p>The headaches may be severe and distressing and need to be managed appropriately.</p>

<h3 id="_remifentanil_analgesia_in_labour">Remifentanil analgesia in labour</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remifentanil is an opioid with ultrafast onset, has organ independent metabolism and short elimination time, which gives it an ideal profile for use as an intravenous opioid in labour. It crosses the placenta, but does not accumulate in the neonate. Only minimal or no side effects have been recorded in the baby. In a survey of Lead Obstetric Anaesthetists undertaken on behalf of the Obstetric Anaesthetists' Association in 2010, it was demonstrated that 36% of respondents offered Remifentanil Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) in labour and that 48% of the remaining units intended to introduce it in the future. However, Remifentanil remains unlicensed in obstetrics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within the West Suffolk Hospital Trust, a Remifentanil PCA is used for labour analgesia only. There will be very small numbers of women in whom conventional labour analgesia is contraindicated. A Remifentanil PCA provides them with a practical effective alternative. In some studies it has been shown to provide superior analgesia to Pethidine. However, as with administration of all opioids, especially via the intravenous route, safe delivery of the drug and careful monitoring of the patient is essential to avoid complications.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An increasing number of women are now undergoing delivery by elective caesarean section, for various reasons. Caesarean section is major abdominal surgery with associated risks and therefore appropriate care and follow-up is required. The estimated fatality rate following elective caesarean section is reported as 136 deaths per 100,000 maternities, relative risk rate 2.8 (CEMACH 2004).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Appropriate and expedient timing of emergency caesarean section is necessary for good fetal and maternal outcome. If timing allows, a regional block technique is safer than general anaesthesia, as it results in less maternal and neonatal morbidity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All women with a high anaesthetic risk must be referred to the Obstetric Anaesthetist for assessment in advance of delivery at a monthly clinic. (See guideline Referral of Obstetric Women to the Anaesthetic Department)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good communication between obstetricians, anaesthetists, midwives and theatre staff is imperative and the classification of urgency of caesarean section indicated below should aid communication.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Insert a large bore intravenous cannula, ideally 16 gauge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commence Hartmann’s solution prior to regional anaesthesia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vasopressor drugs should be used prophylactically to treat hypotension as necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phenylephrine as an infusion is the vasopressor of choice, alternatively ephedrine can be given in 6mg doses to treat hypotension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phenylepherine infusion of 100mcg/ml. is used with the starting rate at 20mls/hr. This is then titrated according to blood pressure and patient symptoms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record and document the woman’s blood pressure as a baseline reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform regional anaesthesia - a spinal, a combined spinal epidural (CSE) or an epidural with the woman in the lateral or sitting position using a fully aseptic technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0.5% Chlorhexidine solution should be used and allowed to dry prior to neuraxial blockade. Chlorhexidine solution must be kept distant to all neuraxial equipment to reduce the risk of adhesive archnoiditis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When performing an epidural or a CSE, loss of resistance to saline is the preferred technique in this institution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A spinal should not be performed above the L2 - L3 interspace as this can be associated with an increased risk of conus injury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A suitable spinal anaesthetic is (11.5 – 12.5mg) 2.3 - 2.5mls 0.5% hyperbaric Bupivacaine plus Diamorphine 300mcg. Diamorphine can provide up to 6 hours of post- operative pain relief. Consider reducing the dose of heavy bupivacaine if the woman is of particularly short stature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5mg Diamorphine should be diluted to 5mls with 0.9% Saline in a 5ml syringe – 1mg perml concentration – 0.3ml of this solution is measured in a 1ml syringe (300mcg) then added to the 0.5% heavy Bupivacaine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An alternative to diamorphine is 15 - 25mcg of Fentanyl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If performing an epidural, the catheter should be inserted to a maximum depth of 3 – 4cm within the epidural space, aspirated to ensure absence of blood or cerebrospinal fluid, and then secured to the woman’s back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Position the woman on the theatre table with left uterine displacement, either with a wedge, or 15 degree table tilt to avoid aorto-caval compression.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intrathecal and epidural opioid administration are well-established analgesic techniques in obstetrics. Diamorphine is a lipid soluble drug which, when given neuraxially provides good pain relief for up to 12 hours. This helps to extend the postoperative analgesia cover with less need for systemic opioid administration. Neuraxial route of administration produces a more targeted analgesic effect with less autonomic and systemic side effects compared to systemic routes. The use of diamorphine in both intrathecal and epidural routes is an established practice and is recommended by NICE1, OAA and AAGBI2.</p>

<h3 id="_cell_salvage_in_obstetrics">Cell salvage in obstetrics</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although red cell salvage is used widely for operative procedures, there have been concerns about its use for obstetric patients. This is mainly due to the theoretical possibility of amniotic fluid embolus and possibility of increased risk of auto immunization of the Rhesus negative mother. By taking the precautions outlined, cell salvage may be safely used in obstetrics.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_recommendations">Recommendations</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If practical, inform the mother about the use and benefits of the cell saver. An information leaflet is available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is recommended that only experienced operators use cell salvage in obstetrics. Trainees should inform the consultant on call if they need to use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may be used for any situation in which allogeneic blood is used, but in practise this has so far been confined to caesarean sections, uterine re-exploration and laparotomy following postpartum haemorrhage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The machine is set up and operated according to standard operating procedure, with an “in-continuity” set-up for Jehovah’s Witnesses should they request. (This means that the whole circuit is run through with saline and the retransfusion bag connected to the IV cannula before starting the salvage suction, thereby establishing a continuous circuit between the blood lost and the recipient vein.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases where there is doubt about the extent of expected blood loss, it is economical to set up the aspiration and reservoir kit only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aim is to routinely set up the cell saver for cases of placenta praevia, postpartum haemorrhage, third or subsequent caesarean sections, Jehovah’s witnesses (if acceptable to the mother) and for mothers with pre-operative haemoglobin levels of 9 g/ dL or below. As staff expertise improves, the use of cell salvage will increase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision to process and retransfuse can be made when the degree of haemorrhage has become clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where practicable, amniotic fluid should be removed by separate suction prior to starting cell salvage. Collection of small amounts of amniotic fluid in the cell salvage reservoir is not a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suction should be via the wide bore sucker in the kit, and the surgeon should try to suction blood from “pools” rather than “dabbing” tissue surfaces with the sucker, which is known to disrupt erythrocytes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blood from swabs can be gently washed with saline and salvaged from a sterile bowl into the main reservoir.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To avoid red cell damage, suction pressure should be kept as low as practicable (&lt;300mm Hg) although higher vacuum can probably be safely used if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is mandatory to use the Pall RS Leucocyte Depletion filter in the retransfusion circuit if there is any risk of amniotic fluid contamination. This is currently the only filter that has been shown to remove all particulate elements of amniotic fluid (fetal squames, lamellar bodies). This will necessarily slow down the rate at which blood can be retransfused but a large volume syringe and 3-way tap could be used to speed up transfusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As with any transfusion, the patient should be carefully monitored for 24 hours. Coagulation tests should be sent post transfusion, and repeated if abnormal or if clinically indicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the patient is Rhesus negative a Kleihauer test should be performed and Anti D given as appropriate within 72 hrs (the cell saver does not remove fetal red cells, which will be infused with the salvaged blood)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A national database of Obstetric Cell Salvage cases is currently being set up via the OAA. Details of this can be found with the consultant obstetric anaesthetists. Hospital units using cell salvage need to keep careful records for audit reporting in due course, with any problems also being reported to the Blood transfusion team as well as MHRA as per NICE Guidelines.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Severe sepsis and septic shock in pregnancy remain an important cause of maternal mortality in the UK. Nationally in 2003 - 2005 there were 13 deaths related to sepsis in pregnancy and substandard care was identified in many of these cases. Between 2006 - 2008 sepsis became the leading cause of maternal mortality, with deaths from Group A Streptococcus (GAS) accounting for 13 deaths.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the most recent MBRRACE report 2009-2012 almost a quarter of women that died had sepsis, and 1 in 11 of the women died from flu.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Severe sepsis has a mortality rate of 20 - 40%, which increases to 60% if septic shock develops. Survival is often related to early recognition and prompt treatment, however previous CMACE reports have found that unfortunately recognition of sepsis is poor and guidelines on management are lacking.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_clinical_care">Clinical care</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The temperature of antenatal women is not recorded routinely. Pyrexia during pregnancy should be treated as clinical signs and symptoms indicate. If accompanied by symptoms such as abdominal pain, investigations should be instigated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All healthcare professionals should be aware of the signs and symptoms of maternal sepsis and of the rapid, potentially lethal course of septic shock. These signs may be less obvious in a pregnant patient compared to non-pregnant patients so a high index of suspicion is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clinical signs include:
* Pyrexia/hypothermia
* Tachycardia/hypotension
* Tachypnoea/hypoxia
* Oligouria
* Impaired consciousness
* Failure to respond to treatment</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regular, frequent observations of all vital signs should be recorded on a MEOWs chart. This should include temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maternal temperature should be checked and recorded at least 4 hourly during labour. Low grade pyrexia (37.8 – 38.4ºC) is common in labouring women, it is a strenuous process, the rooms are kept warm for delivery and a working epidural may alter the patients temperature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A pyrexia of &gt;38.5ºC may indicate underlying infection and needs to be investigated and treated as appropriate. High grade pyrexia in labour &gt;38.5ºC (single reading) or clinical suspicion of infection is a serious complication requiring urgent attention; it may be in indicator of dehydration or infection, including Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection which can lead to chorioamnionitis, sepsis and increased maternal and neonatal morbidity. The Intrapartum Pyrexia (&gt;38.5ºC) care pathway should be followed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If no improvement with treatment or if the patient deteriorates despite starting antibiotics then inform the obstetric and anaesthetic teams and transfer to consultant led care if not already, and commence continuous EFM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All investigations should be taken prior to commencement of antibiotics – however, <strong>do not delay</strong> antibiotic administration, they should be given within 1 hour of diagnosis of suspected sepsis. Follow the Empirical Treatment of Suspected for choice of antibiotics but further advice is available from the consultant microbiologist on call. Commence IV fluids and a start fluid balance chart. A Paediatrician should be present for delivery</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If SIRS or sepsis is suspected in a pregnant woman of any gestation the Obstetric Sepsis Screening Tool should be used. This has been modified from commonly used adult sepsis screening tools to take into consideration the altered physiology of pregnancy, most of which will have occurred by the end of the first trimester.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After delivery – investigations and observation:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take swabs from baby&#8217;s ear, throat and umbilicus, as well as amnion and chorion swabs from the placenta</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Baby monitored unless antibiotics required in which case admit to NNU</p>

<li>
<p>4 hourly maternal observations until normal for 2 readings (complete MEOWS chart)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If prolonged rupture of membranes and other signs of infection give full course of antibiotics (discuss with microbiology)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Broad spectrum antibiotic treatment should be started within 1 hour and should not be delayed by the collection of these samples – each hour delay in antibiotic treatment is associated with a measurable increase in mortality. Give appropriate antibiotic treatment by reviewing patients previous microbiology results if any are available, if postnatal review the baby’s microbiology results as well. Advice and support is always available from the on call consultant microbiologist. Antibiotic effectiveness should be assessed daily and monitor toxicity levels as per hospital guidelines (gentamicin and vancomycin). Change to narrow spectrum when results from cultures are available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CXR may be indicated if there are signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. Prompt imaging may also help localise the source of infection (and therefore treatment) and should not be deferred on the grounds of pregnancy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Serum lactate should be measured within six hours of suspicion of severe sepsis in order to guide management. Lactate &gt;2mmol/L is indicative of tissue hypoperfusion and requires fluid resuscitation. A lactate of &gt;4 mmol/L suggests septic shock and needs input by ITU. Arterial blood gases may help assess hypoxia.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<h4 id="_monitoring_and_delivery_of_fetus">Monitoring and delivery of fetus</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Severe sepsis is associated with preterm labour. Delivery may be considered if the woman is critically ill as this may be beneficial to the mother, baby or both. Attempting delivery in the setting of maternal instability increases fetal and maternal mortality rates unless the source of infection is intrauterine. A decision on mode and timing of delivery should be made by the consultant obstetrician on call. If preterm delivery is anticipated cautious use of steroids may be appropriate to aid foetal lung maturity – however, steroids are an immunosuppressant and so consideration of maternal well-being is important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is recommended in the intrapartum period in women with pyrexia or proven sepsis. Changes in the CTG such as changes in baseline, variability or new onset decelerations should prompt reassessment of maternal MAP, hypoxia and acidaemia as these changes may be due to worsening maternal condition.</p>

<p>If sepsis is suspected in the immediate 24-48 hours post-delivery then use the Obstetric Sepsis Screening Tool. The onset of sepsis can be insidious however and may not reveal itself for several days postpartum when most women will be at home.

<h3 id="_modified_early_warning_scores_meows">Modified early warning scores (MEOWS)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Early warning scoring has proved effective in the general hospital population for the recognition of the unwell or deteriorating patient and prevention of cardiac arrest. Development of scoring systems in the obstetric population has proved more difficult, due to altered physiological parameters of the parturient. However, the recent CMACE reports have highlighted the dangers of not being alert to the deterioration of a sick pregnant or recently delivered woman and recommended the use of an early warning system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 2007 NICE Clinical Guideline ‘Acutely ill Patients in Hospital’ states that all adult patients in an acute hospital setting should have their physiological observations recorded and a scoring system should be used for detecting deteriorating health.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pain is now the ‘5th vital sign’ which the Trust has signed up to. Trust wide audits of pain scoring will be performed, which will include Womens and Childrens Directorate.</p>

<h4 id="_meows_charts">MEOWS charts</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The West Suffolk MEOWS charts are broadly based on the MEWS (Modified Early Warning Score) charts used on every patient in West Suffolk Hospital with changes to reflect the physiology of pregnancy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The chart has been developed for maternal safety in response to national recommendations.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">MEOWS chart protocol</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Charts will be used for all women admitted to F11 and CDS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charts should also be started in AAU or in the Accident and Emergency Department</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is plenty of space on the charts, so new charts need not be started for each admission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to realise that there is no increased frequency of observations (unless the woman deteriorates)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, EVERY observation is scored (see exceptions below) by any member of staff currently able to perform observations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The minimum physiological observations to be recorded and scored are:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Respiratory rate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pulse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Systolic Blood Pressure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diastolic Blood Pressure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urine output (if hourly measurements are in progress) * Temperature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neurological status</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each of the above parameters are scored as per scoring schedule shown on the chart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a threshold score of 3 (without hourly urine measurement) or 4 (with hourly urine measurement) is triggered, the call out cascade must be instituted as shown by the flow diagram on the front of the chart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document the action undertaken if there is a trigger score (a table is on the chart)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With every observation, pain scoring must be undertaken. This will be subject to Trust wide scrutiny as one of the main corporate targets driven by the Dept of Health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A treatment algorithm is available on CDS and F11 to ensure appropriate analgesia is given to women</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is space to record PCA and epidural pump observations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All epidural observations are now recorded on the MEOWS chart (see below for further details) rather than on the reverse of the pink epidural chart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The midwifery postnatal wardex observation chart is on the back page of the MEOWS chart for ease of photocopying for transfer use to the community</p>

<h4 id="_labour">Labour</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of the chart in labour is doubtlessly the most difficult area to address when the mother has the modifying influences of pain and anxiety on her observations. However, even with the most straightforward labour there can be unheralded catastrophes. It would therefore be unwise to deny the women the same level of vigilance as those who are not in labour.</p>
